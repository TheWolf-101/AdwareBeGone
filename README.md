This script was built as a way to automate cleaning up Windows 10/11 from all the adware and unnecessary software that comes with it. It's customizable by commenting and uncomments parts of the script to leave some things installed or to uninstall things that aren't already installed. Near the end of the script it does check for updates to the software on the PC using the built-in Windows feature called "Winget". Feel free to comment it out and do your own thing. Comments and support would be much appreciated!
